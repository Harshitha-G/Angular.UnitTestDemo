                "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is an English-language pangramâ€”a phrase that contains all
                of the letters of the alphabet. It is used to show fonts and to test typewriters and computer keyboards,
                and in other applications involving all of the letters in the English alphabet. Owing to its brevity and
                coherence, it has become widely known.

                The earliest known appearance of the phrase is from The Michigan School Moderator, a journal that provided teachers with education-related news and suggestions for lessons.[1] In an article titled "Interesting Notes" in the March 14, 1885 issue, the phrase is given as a suggestion for writing practice: "The following sentence makes a good copy for practice, as it contains every letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"[2] Note that the phrase in this case begins with the word "A" rather than "The". Several other early sources also use this variation.
